                    <p>The task that was given was to create a working school website using everything we know and looking at examples of what our current school website was. With this task it was looked upon by Ms.Cruz to see what ideas or if the whole website could replace the school website that way it stays fresh and doesn't get repetitive.</p>

                    <h3><li><a href="https://juanito2245.github.io/MVPProject/" target="_blank">MVP Social Issues</a></li></h3></ul>
                      <p>For this task I worked with 2 other group members to pick a social issue and basically create either a website or app that wasn't fully developed in a short amount of time to introduce what work could've been done with more time given.</p>
                <ul class="social-links">    
                  <h3><li><a href="https://juanito2245.github.io/Hire-Me-Profile-Juan-CarloCar12/" target="_blank">Hire Me Profile</a></li></h3></ul>
                    <p>This task was asking for me to meet with a fellow student in our class, preferably someone who I didnâ€™t talk to on a daily basis. That classmate would then be my client and I would have to create a website to the best of my abilities and present them in a respectful and professional manner.</p>

                  <h3><li><a href="https://juanito2245.github.io/Project/" target="_blank">Social Media Page</a></li></h3></ul>
                    <p>This task was worked on by me and another student and it was to create a social media page for a celebrity or content creator we had interests in.</p>
